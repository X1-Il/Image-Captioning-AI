# Image-Captioning-AI
Generate image captions using deep learning and NLP techniques.
ou need to have TensorFlow, Keras, and the InceptionV3 model weights installed. You should also have an image for which you want to generate a caption and specify the path to that image in image_path.

This code uses the InceptionV3 model to extract image features and a caption generation model that consists of an embedding layer, LSTM layer, and dense layers. The generate_caption() function preprocesses the input image, extracts features using InceptionV3, and generates a caption using the caption generation model.
